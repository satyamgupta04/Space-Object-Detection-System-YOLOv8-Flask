# Space-Object-Detection-System-YOLOv8-Flask
Inspired by the safety and monitoring needs of ISRO and NASA missions

Developed a real‑time Space Object Detection system designed to enhance astronaut safety aboard space stations. Using the state‑of‑the‑art YOLOv8 deep learning model, the project detects and labels critical equipment such as Fire Extinguishers, Oxygen Tanks, and Toolboxes with high accuracy, even under challenging conditions.

Built with Python, Flask, and a futuristic space‑themed web interface, the system allows users to simply upload an image and instantly receive annotated results, providing rapid situational awareness and supporting emergency preparedness.

This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence and computer vision can complement initiatives like ISRO’s Project NETRA and NASA’s mission safety research, bridging the gap between orbital situational awareness and on‑board astronaut support.
